w4d is a widgets library for dlang.

## Requirements

- FFmpeg 4.0
- Freetype2 2.9.1
- GLFW 3.2.1 or more
- OpenGL 3.3 or more

If you use Windows, you don't need to do anything.  
(g4d has these libraries only for Windows.)

## Warning

On Windows, you must use VisualStudio's linker.  
And 32bit isn't supported on all platforms.

## Example

You can see projects under `/example/`.
